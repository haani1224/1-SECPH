<summary>Reflection:</summary>
There is so much knowledge that I have gain from the career development and industry talk from PPG. For example, I get to understand how important it is to precisely write your resume or CV based on qualification resume of most companies in order to make yourself more professional. Furthermore, as these abilities are necessary in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) field, honing my soft skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical and non-technical communication is significant.</details>

From this lab, I now know how to disassemble and re-assemble PC component and I also know that certain component are sensitive and needed an attentive care to avoid it to be broken such as we can not touch the gold part on the Random Access Memory(RAM) as it can damage the RAM connection to the Central.</details>

## Design Thinking Project
This design thinking project is where we practice our critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration skills with others to solve the problem related to our topics which is Computer Hardware. For this project, we as a group have to write a report, edit a video, and build a prototype. After completing the project task, we are given additional task where we need to present our design thinking flow and also explaing our prototype function to our class.
