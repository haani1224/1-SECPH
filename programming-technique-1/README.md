# SECJ1013 | Programming Technique 1
This course equips the students with theory and practice on problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. Students are required to develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate problems. The course covers the following: preprocessor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.
